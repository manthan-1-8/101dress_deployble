# 👗 101 Dresses  
### A Trust-First Resale Platform for Occasion Wear

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most fashion resale platforms fail due to:
- Fake returns and item swapping
- False damage claims
- Unsafe and premature payments
- Emotion-based disputes
- No control over logistics

These issues break seller trust and make resale of high-value dresses unsafe.

## 💡 Our Solution

**101 Dresses** is a secure resale platform for **wedding, festive, and party wear** that **controls the entire transaction lifecycle**.

We prevent fraud by controlling:
- **Custody** (platform-managed pickup & delivery)
- **Money** (escrow-based payments)
- **Evidence** (mandatory videos and photos)

> If the platform controls custody, money, and proof — fraud becomes irrational.

## 🎯 Platform Goals

- Prevent theft and return abuse
- Protect both buyers and sellers
- Resolve disputes using proof, not opinions
- Build trust in high-value fashion resale
